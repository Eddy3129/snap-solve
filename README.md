# SnapSolve - Incentivizing Urban Reporting Through Blockchain-Powered Petitions

Welcome to the SnapSolve project! SnapSolve revolutionizes urban reporting by incentivizing petitions, empowering citizens to report issues such as infrastructure damage, while voters prioritize them for swift action. This decentralized platform rewards both reporters and voters, promoting faster responses and greater transparency. Get rewarded by creating or signing petitions—it's that simple!

## Get Updated with the Latest Happenings Around You
Easily access your current location and view the reported issues around you. Stay informed and stay safe! With the power of [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com), everything is open source, and rest assured, we don’t store any of your location data.

## Create Petitions on the Solana Blockchain
Effortlessly create petitions directly on the Solana blockchain. Just provide the details—title, description, location, and an image—and your petition is live on a decentralized platform for all to see.

## Verify Petitions Easily with Petition ID and Transaction Hashes
Once a petition is created, it becomes part of an immutable ledger, guaranteeing transparency and traceability. Simply flip any petition card to view its details and verify it using blockchain explorers like [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com) or [Solscan](https://solscan.io).

## Vote for Petitions with Just a Button Press
The more votes a petition receives, the higher its priority for action. This decentralized voting approach ensures that the most urgent issues are addressed promptly.
